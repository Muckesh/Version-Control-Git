Task 6
Stashing changes for context switching

created index.html file in main branch
updated the index file and committed

git add index.html && git commit -m "Add index file"

created new branch stash-demo
git checkout -b stash-demo

added footer.html in the stash-demo branch
updated the footer file

stashed the updated footer file
git stash -> temporarily saves the unstaged changes.
        we can checkout to another branch only after stashing if we have a unstaged file.

then check out to main branch
git checkout main

git stash list -> it lists all the stashes

git stash pop -> it applies the last stashed changes and removes them from the stash list.

git stash apply <stash-id> -> it applies a specific stash and unlike pop, this does not remove the stash.

git stash drop <stash-id> -> it deletes a specific stash.

git stash clear -> clears all the stashes.

we can apply the stash from one branch to the other branch.
