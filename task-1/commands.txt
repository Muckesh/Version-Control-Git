Git Task 1 Commands:

git init -> To initialize a git repository on the working directory.

git add . -> To add all the files in the working directory to Staging Area (Index Tree).

git commit -m "Added commands text file" -> commiting the file to the local repository.

git branch -M main -> Renaming the default branch Master to main.

git remote add origin <repo-url> -> The remote repo named [origin - default name for the main remote] is linked to the local repo.

git push -u origin main -> pushes the local commits to remote repo.
                        -> -u or --set-upstream --> it sets main as the upstream branch
                           which defaults the future push and pull to origin(remote repo) main(branch).
