Task -2 Git commands

created .gitignore file
Added the following patterns to ignore git staging and tracking:
*.log
secrets.txt
*.tmp
/cache/

git status -> it tracked public.txt, test.py and commands.txt and 
                ignored the file and dir patterns included in .gitignore file like /cache/sample.txt, data.log, bin.tmp
                    secrets.txt.

git add . -> it staged commands.txt, public.txt, .gitignore and test.py.

git commit -m "Testing .gitignore - The log, tmp files are ignored and the directory /cache/ is also ignored" 
    -> commited the files to the local repo.

git rm --cached <filename> -> to remove the file that is already staged before adding it in the .gitignore file.
