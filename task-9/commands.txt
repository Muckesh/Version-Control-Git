remote repo -> it is a version of the project hosted on platform like github, gitlab or bitbucket
                allowing multiple developers to Collaborate.

git init -> initializes a local repo.

go to github and create a Repository

copy the remote url

link local repo to remote repo (on github)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Muckesh/Version-Control-Git.git

git remote -v -> to verify remote link.

git add . && git commit -m "initial commit" -> staging and pushing local changes to local repo.

git push -u origin main -> first time push creates a 'main' branch on github with a remote repo named origin.
                        '-u' sets the upstream branch to main.

git checkout -b feature-branch -> creates a new branch named feature-branch

modify or add files in the feature-branch.

git add . && git commit -m "added new feature" -> stage and commit the changes to the local repo

git push origin feature-branch -> pushes the branch to the remote repo.
